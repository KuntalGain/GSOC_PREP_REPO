# GSOC_PREP_REPO

Hey everyone, I hope you are doing well.

Well, you already know that from the 20th of March, the Google Summer of Code 2023 registration will start, and for that purpose, we should start preparing. The majority of members want to be full-stack web developers, so I have decided that our topic should be web-related. Therefore, I need to know how much you know about development honestly. It's not a problem if you win or lose, just try hard to do so. Please take roles.

## We require:

- Frontend Developers (HTML, CSS, React)
- Backend Developers (Python, JS)
- QA Tester
- Proposal Writer (by @Aisha Halder & @Himadri)
